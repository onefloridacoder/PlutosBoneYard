## This is a project I'm using, or used depending when you read this, to decompose a legacy application to push it into Azure.  Taking the existing API service layer into a SaaS context.  The UI should be along soon, for Azure hosting as well.  For some of the service calls I'd likek to incorporate Azure Functions as well to relieve the dependency on Sql Server C# stored procedures.
